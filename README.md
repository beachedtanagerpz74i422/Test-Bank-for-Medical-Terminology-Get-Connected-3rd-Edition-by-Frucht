  * Medical Terminology: Get Connected! is an intro-level essentials text. It prepares you to make connections, whether that's joining word parts into medical terms, understanding body systems or forging professional relationships. Unlike other medical terminology resources, this text presents terms by medical specialty, rather than organ systems, giving it practical use.
 
  * Medical terms for all key body systems are covered in the context of 15 medical specialties. Additionally, the combining forms, suffixes and prefixes common to each medical specialty are defined in a section of each chapter, reinforcing connections.
 
  * The fully updated 3rd Edition now has more engaging practice exercises and more robust visuals. It also narrows in on the work of healthcare practitioners who use medical terms daily.
